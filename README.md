# Certifications
Certification is a WebApp, with the help of certifications mark-sheet of the student can be verified.There are two pages to this WebApp Creating new certificate and verifying the existing one, the Admin(HOD or staff) can enter the newly 
issued mark-sheet of the student in this by entering the roll number and the marks of the respective student. After submitting the data,
the hash of it will be entered to the blockchain.
To verify the certificate the hash has to be entered in the verify page. If hash is found in the blockchain, the certificate is said to be verified else 
not verified.

## Future Scope:<br/>
After submitting the new certificate, a pdf is generated and sent to the mail of the student and hash of that pdf is generated and stored in the blockchain.
And while verifying the pdf is uploaded in the system and if the hash of that pdf is found it says verified else non verified.
